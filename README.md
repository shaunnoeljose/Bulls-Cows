The game is played between 2 users. The first player chooses a secret non repeating 4-digit number and the aim of the game is for the second player to guess that number correctly.
 After each guess the player 1 gives the information about the number of bulls and cows to the user.  Bulls are the number of common digits in the exact place when comparing between guess and the secret.
